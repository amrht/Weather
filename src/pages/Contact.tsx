              Good to see you are interested in me or one of my projects! If you
              are looking for a website or app, please email me or say hi at one
              of the social networks listed at the bottom. I'm always good to

              All my open source projects have their own GitHub Repository where
              you can create issues if you find a bug. Explain what happened
              when the bug occurred and Iâ€™ll see what I can do. You can also suggest your own ideas to this project to make it better.
